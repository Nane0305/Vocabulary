As for me, I like spring for its first warm days. 
When the snow begins to melt and streamlets can be seen everywhere in the streets, the air becomes fresh 
and it is filled with aroma of flowers. The sky looks extremely blue and the first tiny leaves begin to appear. 
The ground is covered with fresh green grass and the first spring flowers. The sun shines brightly and the warmth 
brings new hopes and joy. People feel younger and stronger. When the days become warm enough we may have a walk 
in the woods or by the river, play ball-games, lie in the sun and even have a swim. It is my favourite season, 
because it always brings new hopes and expectations, new joys and a lot of fun.
